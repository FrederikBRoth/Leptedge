# Leptedge
 Cool game made with cool tools

### What the fuck is this even?

This is gonna be a Leptos powered website using wasm32 in order to be able to host a selfmade videogame using Wgpu. 

I have very litle experience using the Leptos Framework and even less experience using Wgpu and the vulkan rendering pipeline as a whole. Not a very good start

I do however have a lot of experience with webdev frameworks as a whole and i have also dappled a lot in using graphical APIS such as OpenGL. Just this year i remade Minecraft from scratch in C++. 
Therefor i feel like i can use my general knowledge of both of these different sides of programming into this project using very niche but interesting tools. (also because i get to code in Rust. I like rust)

### Where the fuck do i even start?

A long time will be used on getting to know the ins and outs of the Wgpu package, but more so the Vulcan API. The Vulcan API does things a bit differently than OpenGL so learning those will be the biggest hurdle
The Leptos framework is most likely the easiest of the two to get down, and will also be the smallest part. Will be done will be done at the end of the project

I hope i can have a semi working, self hosted, non crashing prototype by the end of the next couple of months. Studies killing me so i might not have that much time. My goal is to work on the skillset 
required every day atleast.
